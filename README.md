## Title:

How to test web frontends

## Abstract: 

Automated testing is an important topic in software development. Without testing, you simply won't produce any working software.
Simply clicking through your interface will not find you all the bugs. Testing everything manually is a
repetitive task that is boring and, in the long run, very expensive.

In this talk, Nils will show you how to test web-frontends automatically. This is not easy, because 
a frontend is naturally used by humans, not machines. But with the right tools and mindset, we will see that 
it is possible to automate frontend tests. It can even be fun.

Nils has been writing code since he was a child and has been working as a web-developer since 2007.
